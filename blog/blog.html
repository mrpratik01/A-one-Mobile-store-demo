          Technology has had an impact on practically every element of life in
          the twenty-first century, including daily life, sociability, and
          productivity. The power of technology has made it easier for global
          communities to establish and share ideas and resources. As a result of
          technological advancements, human existence has altered tremendously.
          Nowadays, technology is present in almost every thing. Technology
          offers a vast range of applications that we utilize in school,
          college, and our homes, ranging from simple to complex goods. In the
          twenty-first century, we can consider the internet to be a tremendous
          reservoir of information. The Internet is a global network that
          connects all of the world's computers. It's made it easier for us to
          communicate, share ideas, and stay informed about what's going on in
          the world.
